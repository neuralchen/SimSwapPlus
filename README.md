# VGGFace2-HQ Dataset
VGGFace2-HQ contains more than $1.36M$ $512 \times 512$ aligned
face images and up to $9, 630$ distinct identities. In addition, this dataset
consists of two parts:
- (1) a natural image sub-collection, which collects up to $200, 000$ images covering $1, 000$ different identities;
- (2) a synthetic image sub-collection, containing $8, 630$ cleaned and re-annotated identities (i.e., clean up the images with mismatching identities and low-quality faces in the cropped [VGGFace2](https://github.com/ox-vgg/vgg_face2)).
